- **Comprehensive port scanning** with support for custom ranges and presets
- **Service detection** with banner grabbing and version identification
- **Vulnerability assessment** with CVE lookup and risk level evaluation
- **Nmap integration** for advanced scanning features
- **Interactive mode** for post-scan analysis
- **Multiple output formats** including CLI, JSON, CSV, and XML
- **Tool recommendations** based on discovered services
- **Nmap script suggestions** for deeper investigation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Recommended: Nmap installed for advanced features

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-scanner.git
   cd advanced-scanner
Install required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) For enhanced service detection, download Nmap service probes:

bash
wget https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/nmap-service-probes -O nmap-service-probes.txt
Usage
Basic Scanning
bash
python scanner.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p top100 -s t3
Advanced Options
bash
python scanner.py \
  -t 192.168.1.0/24 \  # Target IP range
  -p 1-1024 \          # Port range
  -th 100 \            # 100 threads
  -s t4 \              # Comprehensive scan
  -o json \            # JSON output
  --nmap \             # Use Nmap integration
  -v                   # Verbose output
Interactive Mode
After scanning, you can enter interactive mode to:

Rescan specific ports

Perform deep vulnerability scans

Run recommended Nmap scripts

Launch suggested security tools

Generate custom reports

Output Formats
CLI: Colorful console output (default)

JSON: Structured JSON data

CSV: Comma-separated values

XML: XML formatted output

Scan Types
Type	Description	Timeout	Features
t1	Fast scan	1s	Basic connectivity
t2	Stealth scan	2s	Randomized timing
t3	Standard	3s	Service detection
t4	Comprehensive	5s	OS detection, scripts
t5	Deep scan	10s	Vulnerability assessment
Examples
Quick scan of top 100 ports:

bash
python scanner.py -t 10.0.0.1
Full vulnerability assessment of a web server:

bash
python scanner.py -t 192.168.1.100 -p 80,443,8000-9000 -s t5 -o all
Network-wide scan with Nmap integration:

bash
python scanner.py -t 192.168.1.0/24 -p top1000 --nmap
Documentation
Configuration
The scanner includes several configuration options in the script:

VULN_API_SOURCES: Vulnerability databases to query

EXPLOIT_SOURCES: Exploit database endpoints

TOOL_SUGGESTIONS: Recommended tools per service

COMMON_PORTS: Common port presets

NMAP_SCRIPTS: Recommended Nmap scripts per service

Customization
